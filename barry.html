            <p class="explain">Barry is an American dark comedy–crime television series created by Alec Berg and Bill Hader that premiered on HBO on March 25, 2018.</p>
            <p class="summary">Summary: Disillusioned at the thought of taking down another "mark," depressed, low-level hit man Barry Berkman seeks a way out. When the Midwesterner reluctantly travels to Los Angeles to execute a hit on an actor who is bedding a mobster's wife, little does Barry know that the City of Angels may be his sanctuary. He follows his target into acting class and ends up instantly drawn to the community of eager hopefuls, especially dedicated student Sally, who becomes the object of his affection. While Barry wants to start a new life as an actor, his handler, Fuches, has other ideas, and the hit man's criminal past won't let him walk away so easily.</p>

            <p>Sally Reed (the main female 'protagonist') ruins the experience. No redeeming qualities, hard to sympathise with, superficial, only wants what she wants and blames other people for her negative outcomes.</p>

            <p>Barry is unlike any show I have ever seen. It is full of dark moments and complex themes, yet still manages to be funny and down to earth.</p>

            <p>The show is hilarious and dares to cross into darker territory at any time. Brilliant show by all means.</p>

            <p class="blog1">He’s really just some quiet guy who stumbled into an acting class on his way to killing one of the students before getting pulled on stage to essentially ruin a scene. He doesn’t charm her, impress her or make her laugh. He really just goes along for the ride. Sally likes Barry, it seems, because she has to in order to move the plot forward. In “Chapter One: Make Your Mark,” Barry explains how he got into the hit-man industry — home from Afghanistan, feeling placeless and probably wrestling with some PTSD, he accepted an offer from a family friend with connections — but he’s recently been having trouble explaining to himself why he stays in it.</p>

            <p class="blog1">That’s not to say that “Barry” is devoid of any redeeming qualities. The show does a good job of depicting what it’s like to be a struggling actor trying to make it big, and the HBO budget pays off with some incredible sequences, like the last few minutes of the pilot episode, and just about every scene involving Henry Winkler, who’s been starting to run away with the show.</p>
